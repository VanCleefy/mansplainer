Planets are celestial bodies orbiting a star or stellar remnant that are massive enough to be rounded by their own gravity, have cleared their neighbouring region of planetesimals, and are not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion. The eight planets in our Solar System are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
